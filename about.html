            <h3>Hi,</h3>

            My name is Nino and I'm a software developer from Oldenburg.<br><br>
            
            I started my programming journey in 2021 when I bought the awesome book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes and worked through the chapters.<br><br>
            
            I was lucky to get a job in the field of Data Science, because that's where I could practice my Python skills and got to write a lot of code. Which was tough at first, but got easier the more I learned. <br><br>
            
            Besides that, I've been branching out a little to learn a more technologies.
            For example, I've build my first App for Android/Ios and I'm about to launch it to the app store.<br><br>
            
            Oh, and this little portfolio website, but I probably don't need to tell you that.<br><br>
            
            My goal is keep learning about software development to build apps that make people happy.<br><br>
